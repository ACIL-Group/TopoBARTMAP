# TopoBARTMAP


# About

# Quick Start

## Installation
Clone the code to needed folder and add to the path in MATLAB,
```
> addpath("Classes","Evaluation","Functions");
```

## Usage
**Input Data**
The data is assumed to be a matrix of shape #featuresX#observations, ie., features/genes are assumed to be the rows, whilst observations are assumed to be columns.
